 - Question 1: How do you specify a TCP socket in Python?
 => `socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)`


 - Question 2: What is the difference between a client socket and a server socket in Python?
=> Binds to IP and PORT. 
Cient socket intializes a connection to server. While a server socket sends and waits for a 
connection from a client socket.

 - Question 3: How do we instruct the OS to let us reuse the same bind port?
=> socket.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)

 - Question 4: What information do we get about incoming connections?
=> Connected by ('127.0.0.1', 63927) - IP and PORT

 - Question 5: What is returned by recv() from the server after it is done sending the HTTP request?
=> We get - b'OK' . It returns a byte and a string saying 'OK'.

 - Question 6: Provide a link to your code on GitHub.
